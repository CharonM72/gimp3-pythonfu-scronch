# gimp3-pythonfu-scronch
A fairly simple GIMP 3.0 Python-fu script that will export the full, flattened, current image as an .avif (or optionally .png) with smart filenaming.


Intended to be set to a keyboard shortcut for quick and easy exporting.


ONLY WORKS IN GIMP 3.0+ - For a Gimp 2.x-compatible version, see https://github.com/CharonM72/gimp2-pythonfu-scronch


To use, place the scronch.py file (or clone the repo) into:

Windows:

C:\Users\[yourname]\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins\scronch

Unix-like:

~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/scronch/

Change the version number above as needed (e.g. 3.1)

The script will be registered directly at the bottom of Filters.
